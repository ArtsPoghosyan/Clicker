                <h1>What is the clicker counter?</h1>
                <p>The click counter is a free online tool that you can use to count up and down or to calculate a number. Unlike an automatic counter, this one is manual and you set the value yourself. Click on plus to increment the counter or minus to decrement it: the value adjusts automatically.</p>
                <p>The tap counter records the number of clicks automatically in your browser, but if you refresh the page, clear the cache or use the private browsing mode, everything will be lost. If you need several counters simultaneously, open several tabs.</p>

                <p>To make sure you don't make mistakes and to avoid using your memory, using a counter can be useful.</p>
